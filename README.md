# review_scrapper

In this small program(kinda project), I have  fetched and parsed "flipkart" webpages using python, stored it in local mongoDB server and shown in a table in basic html file.

### Concepts demonstrated: 
1. Python Coding: Web Crawling & HTML Parsing.
2. Basics of mongoDB.
3. HTML & CSS basics.

The whole code is well documented.

### Some screenshots:
